      "Dr. Lucia Moreno is a 35-year-old physician with curly brown hair and warm, hazel eyes. She works at the San Rafael Health Post, where she is responsible for treating patients with Chagas disease. Lucia is driven by a deep sense of empathy and a desire to make a difference in her community. However, she struggles with the feeling of being overwhelmed by the sheer number of patients and the limited resources available to her. She longs for a more efficient way to diagnose and treat Chagas disease, and hopes to find innovative solutions to improve patient outcomes.\n"
